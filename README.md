Simple app for finding repositories in Github using Github API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Also it uses:
 - [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) for components styling
 - [Flow](https://flow.org/) for type checking
 - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [AirBnb config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)
 - [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)
